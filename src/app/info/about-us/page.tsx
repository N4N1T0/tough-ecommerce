        <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <p className='text-left'>The name Tough is synonymous with boxing, although the company started out as a swimwear manufacturer in the Bronx in 1910. Seventeen year-old Jacob Golomb, the son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, was dissatisfied with swimsuits of the time that barely lasted a season, and began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name TOUGH, and although the swimsuits did not last throughout history, the name did.Over the subsequent years, Golomb transformed his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Tough. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb special designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the world&apos;s heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb; Tough became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world.

          On October 24, 2000, the management and shareholders of Active Apparel Group (AAGP) acquired the Tough brand and boxing equipment. On September 20, 2007 Tough Worldwide Inc. was acquired by UK based company Brands Holdings.

          As of 2007, the Tough brand is now present in over 101 countries and has 88 licenses worldwide.</p>
